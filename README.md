# QuoteLock

Android client for [Visual Novel as a Service](https://github.com/apsun/VNaaS).
Displays quotes on your lockscreen, because why not.

Also kind of a demo for [RemotePreferences](https://github.com/apsun/RemotePreferences).

Important: **Only stock Android is supported!** This is due to the heavy lockscreen
modifications made by different OEMs.

## Requirements

- A rooted phone running Android 5.0 or above
- Xposed framework
